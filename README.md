# üöÄ Automatic Syntax Limited Sniper

**Automatic Syntax Limited Sniper** is an advanced Python script designed for skilled users who are well-versed in Python programming. This tool automates the process of sniping limited items in your favorite online marketplace. It comprises two main components: an autosearch module and a buyer module. The autosearch module continuously monitors the marketplace for newly listed limited items, while the buyer module efficiently purchases the desired items. Please note that this tool does not have a graphical user interface (GUI) because, after extensive coding, we decided to focus on functionality over aesthetics. 

## üåü Key Features

- **Autosearch Module**: Continuously scans the marketplace for newly listed limited items and provides real-time updates.

- **Buyer Module**: Automatically purchases limited items when they become available, based on predefined criteria.

- **Customization**: You can configure the tool to target specific limited items and set purchasing rules.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Before diving into the setup, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Configuration

To set up both the autosearch module and the buyer module, you need to edit the `autosearch.py` and `buyer.py` files and insert your cookie value. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `autosearch.py` file using a text editor of your choice.

2. Look for the following line in the code:

```python
cookie_value = "your_cookie_here"
```

3. Replace `"your_cookie_here"` with your actual marketplace cookie value. You can typically find your cookie in your browser's developer tools after logging into the marketplace. It's essential to keep this value confidential.

4. Open the `buyer.py` file using a text editor.

5. Locate the following line:

```python
cookie_value = "your_cookie_here"
```

6. Replace `"your_cookie_here"` with your actual marketplace cookie value.

### Usage

1. Run the autosearch module:

```bash
python autosearch.py
```

2. Run the buyer module:

```bash
python buyer.py
```

Please note that running these modules requires a deep understanding of the Python programming language, as well as knowledge of web scraping and automation techniques. The code is designed for educational purposes, and using it for unethical activities is strongly discouraged.
